# Process Simulation Website

This project is a dynamic website that simulates processes using various scheduling algorithms, generating Gantt charts and providing detailed analytics such as Arrival Time (AT), Burst Time (BT), Finish Time (FT), Turnaround Time (TAT), and Waiting Time (WT). The implemented algorithms include:

- First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Priority (Preemptive and Non-preemptive)

## Features

- Simulation of processes with interactive Gantt chart visualization.
- Calculation of key metrics for performance evaluation.
- Supports multiple scheduling algorithms for comparison and analysis.
- User-friendly interface with options to simulate and analyze different scenarios.
